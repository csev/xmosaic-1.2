{"name":"Xmosaic-1.2","tagline":"XMosaic-1.2 (1993) - Running Native under X-Windows on Mac OS/X","body":"# ``xmosaic-1.2``\r\n\r\nI took a few hours, downloaded ``xmosaic-1.2`` and got it working on Max OS X as part\r\nof an article I was writing - the code is here in case you want to experience what the\r\nweb was like in 1993 :)\r\n\r\n## Demonstration\r\n\r\nHere is a [YouTube Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxx528av7ns) demonstrating the \r\napplication.\r\n\r\n## Building ``xmosaic``\r\n\r\nThe ``xmosaic-1.2`` package can be built on a growing number of platforms, but each has its own\r\npre-requisites and dependencies. On all platforms, you will need a C compiler such as gcc.\r\n\r\n### Pre-requisites by platform\r\n\r\n#### Ubuntu Linux\r\n\r\nInstall the required dependencies before building:\r\n\r\n\t$ apt-get install build-essential libxmu-dev libxmu-headers libxpm-dev libmotif-dev imagemagick\r\n\r\n#### Mac OS X (10.6+)\r\n\r\nOn <b>10.8 and later</b>, download and install XQuartz:\r\n\r\n\thttp://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/\r\n\r\nOn all versions, download and install OpenMotif:\r\n\r\n\thttp://www.ist-inc.com/motif/download/index.html\r\n\r\nOpenMotif installs into ``/usr/OpenMotif``\r\n\r\n#### Solaris 9 (32-bit)\r\n\r\nThe following Solaris packages need to be installed:\r\n\r\n\tSUNWxwice (X Window System Inter-Client Exchange (ICE) Components)\r\n\tSUNWxwplt (X Window System platform software)\r\n\tSUNWxwrtl (X Window System & Graphics Runtime Library Links in /usr/lib)\r\n\r\n### Compiling the code\r\n\r\nA top-level Makefile with platform targets is provided and recommended for all builds:\r\n\r\n\t$ make linux     # Build for Linux\r\n\t$ make osx       # Build for Mac OS X\r\n\t$ make solaris9  # Build for Solaris 9\r\n\r\nThe original NCSA ``README`` and the subsidiary ``Makefiles`` provide more details.\r\n\r\nTo start ``xmosaic``:\r\n\r\n\t$ cd src\r\n\t$ ./xmosaic &\r\n\r\n## Pre-built binaries\r\n\r\nHere is a compiled [Binary Macintosh Distribution](https://github.com/csev/xmosaic-1.2/blob/master/XMosaic.zip?raw=true) \r\nthat should work on Max OS X 10.6 or later (with the pre-requisites installed).\r\n\r\nI am *not* an expert in Mac OS X application distribution so I don't have \r\nany kind of one-click installer simply because I don't have the skills to \r\nmake such an installer.\r\n\r\n## Changes from original NCSA release\r\n\r\nI have made very few changes to let it browse a bit more of the web\r\nreasonably:\r\n\r\n* It uses HTTP/1.1 instead of HTTP 1.0 so it can see virtual hosted sites\r\n\r\n* It uses sips for OS X to convert all images to gif to give best chance of seeing them. Under Linux it uses imagemagick.\r\n\r\n* It ignores ampersand hex values as those were not invented yet\r\n\r\n* It hides content between script and style tags as those were not invented yet\r\n\r\nIt also is pretty chatty in the console while it is running - I am still \r\nworking on the code and want to see if it breaks.\r\n\r\n![XMosaic 1.2 running on Max OSX](XMosaic/xmosaic.jpg)\r\n\r\n![XMosaic 1.2 viewing info.cern.ch](XMosaic/info-cern.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
