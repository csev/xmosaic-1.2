See document FEATURES for canonical list of features.

From 1.1 to 1.2
...............

 o Binary transfer mode, when on, now forces all files to be treated as
   binary, whether or not their extensions are recognized.  (Due to
   overwhelming popular request.) 
 o Gopher file types are now picked up on the basis of file extension, if a
   file extension exists, with the default being the normally assumed
   type.  This means that "foo.ps" returned as type '0' (text) is interpreted
   as PostScript, etc.  Resource tweakGopherTypes (default True) can be
   set to False to turn this off and interpret Gopher documents stricly by
   the Gopher typing system.  
 o Resource postscriptViewerCommand is now "dump" by default.  This
   is because ghostview (the previous default), as currently shipped, runs
   ghostscript in unsafe mode and a malicious PostScript file could cause
   damage to your filesystem as a result.  
 o Added fullHostname resource to allow explicit setting of the fully
   qualified hostname (machine.domain).  We recommend you don't use
   this resource (allow Mosaic to determine your full hostname on the
   fly) unless your system chokes on gethostbyname().  
 o Fixed problem with annotationServer resource set and annotation
   server not available or network down.  
 o Fixed problem with missing title (or author) in annotation.  
 o Fixed occasional coredump in File->Reload.  
 o Fixed occasional crash with inlined images after windows have been
   closed.  
 o Made failure of gethostbyname() robust (coredumps actually inside
   gethostbyname() must still be dealt with by the gethostbynameIsEvil
   resource).  
 o Fixed coredump when checking for editable annotation property when
   document contains no text.  
 o Fixed coredump when closing window if hotkey is hit while window
   is still open but in the process of being destroyed.  
 o Local files should now always be automatically canonicalized into a
   full URL of form file://hostname/full/path/filename -- this applies to
   command-line arguments and to filenames passed through
   File->Open.
 o Now recognize file://localhost/ scheme for expressly accessing local
   files.  
 o Fixed problem with multiline FTP server responses (courtesy John
   Ockerbloom).  
 o Fixed problem with ".." in FTP directory resulting in slash falling off
   of toplevel URL and subsequent jumps failing.  
 o Fixed problem with trailing slashes in FTP directory specifications
   that were causing part of the directory name to be used twice.  
 o Changed sgimoviePlayerCommand default to movieplayer, which
   actually exists on some SGI systems.  
 o Made a few changes to menubar Documents and Help menus.  
 o Cleaned up lots of typecasting warnings in Xmx code.  
 o Fixed problem with Motif 1.2 and file insertions in annotate window.  
 o Fixed problem with double quotes in titles of group annotations.  
 o Added resource reverseInlinedBitmapColors to allow reversal of
   foreground and background colors in inlined XBM bitmaps.  
 o Fixed problem with group annotations on URL's containing pound
   signs (normally this never happens, but it will happen for HDF files in
   Mosaic 2.0).  
 o Added confirmation box for deleting annotations from the menubar;
   added resource confirmDeleteAnnotation, defaults to true.  
 o Correctly recognizes mis-suffixed HTML files starting with <head>,
   <html>, and <HTML> tags also now.  
 o XPM3-format inlined image support fixed.  

From 1.0 to 1.1
...............

 o Hotkeys in document view windows.  
 o Color leaks and glitches in inlined image support fixed.  
 o Support for TMPDIR environment variable, as well as resource 
   tmpDirectory and command-line flag -tmpdir, for specifying
   location of tmp directory for transient data files.  
 o Added GUI-supported modification of hotlist entry titles.  
 o Added ISMAP tag support to IMG tag (courtesy Tony Sanders).  
 o CSO phonebook support (courtesy Lou Montulli).  
 o Added printing/saving straight to PostScript (courtesy Ameet A.  Raval).
   No support for images yet, though.  
 o Fixed typo in Motif 1.2 support in HTML widget.  
 o Fixed typo (nothing was broken, just caused it to be a little slow
   sometimes) in document page handling.  
 o Two spaces between sentences in pretty selections now.  
 o SGML comments are now ignored.  
 o Updated copyright notice.  
 o Documentation hyperlinks point straight to new NCSA server.  
 o Mosaic can now be remotely controlled via signals by a parent process;
   e.g., to allow use as a browser for context-sensitive help from another
   application.  More information coming...  
 o Default rgbViewerCommand is now 'xv' on non-SGI platforms, since xv
   3.0 now handles SGI RGB files.  
 o New WAIS interface document, pointing to NCSA gateway.  
 o URL of document is now sent in 'Mail To...' messages.  
 o <cite> now supported.  
 o <blockquote> now supported.  
 o <var> now uses italics.  
 o Fixed rare parsing/layout coredumps.  
 o Fixed rare pretty selection coredumps.  
 o Fixed stupid memory and file-handling glitches; made hotlist and other
   config file-handling much more robust.  
 o Properly handle (nuke) newlines in titles and URL's now.  
 o Fixed rare stupid coredumps in Motif lists.  
 o No more coredump when saving/printing/mailing empty file.  
 o Mosaic now has no default geometry resource value.  Initial window
   placement and toplevel dialog placement will be entirely according to
   your window manager's settings.  
 o Added resource percentVerticalSpace to allow customization of the space
   between paragraphs, between headers and paragraphs, etc.  in the HTML
   widget.  
 o Fixed coredump when starting Mosaic with home page a directory with
   no slashes in the specification.  
 o Added recognition of '.gz' for gzip'd files, as per GNU change.  
 o Fixed glitch with X bitmaps served by Gopher servers as inlined images.  
 o Added editres support.  
 o Added Motif 1.2 tearoff menu support.  
 o Better DEC Alpha OSF/1 support.  
 o Better Dell SVR4 support.  
 o A few more source cleanups for NeXT support.  
 o Reorganized Documents menu and added new options to Help menu.  
 o Added support for group annotation server (not yet available).  
 o Cleaned up src/Makefile (some).  
 o Suffixes .dump and .saveme are now recognized and trigger binary
   file dump to local disk.  
 o Busy cursor now shows up more often, like it should.  
 o HDF files are now recognized and passed to Collage via Collage's -load
   option, which isn't yet in a released version.  
 o Miscellaneous bug fixes and cleanups.  

From 0.13 to 1.0
................

 o Added new resource, gethostbynameIsEvil, for Sun's that
   coredump when gethostbyname() is called to try to find out what
   their own names are. (Command-line flag is -ghbnie.) 
 o Explicitly pop down all dialog boxes when document view
   window is closed, for window managers too dull to do so
   themselves. 
 o Better visited anchor color for non-SGI's. 
 o Added .hqx and .uu to list of file extensions handled like .tar files. 
 o Added 'Clear' button to Open box, to allow more convenient
   cut-n-paste entries of URL's. 
 o New resource 'autoPlaceWindows'; if set to False, new document
   view windows will not be automatically positioned by the
   program itself (but it's still up to your window manager just how
   they're placed). 
 o Command-line flags -i and -iconic now have desired effect (new
   resource initialWindowIconic can also be used). 
 o Gif-reading code is a little more bulletproof. 
 o Obscure infinite loop triggered by extra space in IMG tag fixed. 
 o Eliminated nonintuitive error message when image can't be read
   (inlined NCSA bitmap is indication enough that something's not
   right for authors, and readers can't do anything about bad images
   in any case). 
 o Obscure parsing bug (for constructs like <ADDRESS><A
   HREF=...>text<A></ADDRESS>) fixed. 
 o Fixed mysterious stupid coredump that only hits Suns. 
 o Fixed stupid coredump on URL's like '://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/'. 
 o Fixed buglet in handling rlogin URL's. 
 o New support for Solaris/SYSVR4 (courtesy
   dana@thumper.bellcore.com). 
 o Better support for HP-UX 8.x and 9.x (courtesy
   johns@hpwarf.wal.hp.com). 
 o Better support for NeXT (courtesy scott@shrug.dur.ac.uk). 
 o Some miscellaneous portability fixes (courtesy
   bingle@cs.purdue.edu). 
 o Miscellaneous bug fixes and cleanups. 

From 0.12 to 0.13
.................

 o Fixed occasional mysterious coredump in startup routines. 
 o Fixed occasional stupid coredump in freeing document text. 
 o Fixed silly coredump on accessing malformed URLs like
   ftp:/tcp/xxx.yyy.zzz.www. 
 o Fixed URL parsing choke on accessing URL 'test.html#foobar' as
   an initial program argument. 
 o Added system() call error reporting. 
 o Changed default anchor representations: blue and single solid
   underline for unvisited, dark purple and single dashed underline
   for visited. 
 o Jumping from 2nd+ document page to 1st document page in a
   single document via anchors works now. 
 o Various glitches with scrollbars, document pages, etc. fixed. 
 o New toggle-button options (caseless, backwards) in File->Search
   window. 
 o File->Search doesn't put search results on top line of window. 
 o Use of -l flag for rlogins restored. 
 o Built-in finger interface with faces support (thanks, Marc V of
   IU!). 
 o Miscellaneous bug fixes and cleanups. 

From 0.11 to 0.12
.................

 o Files retrieved via binary transfer mode now get a file selection box
   for user-provided filename. 
 o Inlined image widths are now taken into account when formatting
   text & images together. 
 o Fixed trigger of server bug on some systems wrt freeing color cells. 
 o Inlined images work on 24-bit TrueColor servers now. 
 o GUI interface for mailing hotlist and window history lists. 
 o Support for <ol> (numbered lists). 
 o Better support for nested description lists. 
 o Support for <tt>, <b>, <i>, <em>, <strong>, <code>, <samp>,
   <kbd>, <var>, and corresponding resources italicFont, boldFont, and
   fixedFont. 
 o Better 8-bit cleanliness. 
 o Bug with inlined images as anchors at end of documents fixed. 
 o Compact description lists: <dl compact> causes first line of <dd>
   text to jump up on same line with <dt> if room exists. 
 o SGML representations of 8-bit ISO8859 characters now work. 
 o Fixed bugs with weird Lucida font metrics on DEC Alpha and a few
   other servers. 
 o Fixed coredump triggered by <li>'s outside of a list. 
 o Fixed coredumps on malformed URL's like telnet:machine.name. 
 o Fixed coredumps on malformed URL's like
   gopher:/gopher.uiuc.edu/. 
 o Various document types returned via WAIS searches are now
   detected (by extension only) and forked to viewers as appropriate. 
 o Fixed minor bug with disappearing whitespace. 
 o Fixed bug with extraneous newlines in description lists in very
   narrow windows. 
 o Fixed bug with erroneous description elements causing text to fall
   off the left side of the screen. 
 o Audio annotations on HP systems with audio hardware work now. 
 o Default SGI audio annotation quality is lower now, to decrease disk
   space usage. 
 o SCO Open Desktop support. 
 o Harris Nighthawk support. 
 o AIX 3.2 support for reading local directories. 
 o Minor bugfixes and cleanups. 

From 0.10 to 0.11
.................

 o Bug fix for non-SGI X servers: bitmaps now show up with
   correct (normal foreground and background) colors.
 o Bug fix for Ultrix: no more meaningless coredumps when
   closing windows.

From 0.9 to 0.10
................

 o Support for <IMG> tag: inlined images in HTML documents.
    o Handles X bitmap and GIF formats so far.
    o New resource, colorsPerInlinedImage, can be used to restrict
      color use of inlined images -- default is 50.
    o Image files can be located anywhere on the net (pointed to by
      URL); image data is cached in memory for fast display and
      reuse.
    o Example of inlined bitmap: 
      <IMG SRC="file://foobar.com/foobar.xbm">
    o Example of inlined image serving as anchor: 
      <A HREF="http://foobar.com/ref.html"> 
      <IMG SRC="file://foobar.com/blagh.gif"> </A>
 o Better support for acting as binary file retrieval client.
    o Each window can either be in binary transfer mode or not;
      resource binaryTransferMode controls startup value (default
      is 'False', and you probably don't want to change this). A
      toggle button in the Options menu allows changing on the fly.
    o If a window is not in binary trasfer mode, data files with
      unrecognized types will be displayed in the window as either
      plain text or HTML (depending on the server type), as before.
    o If a window is in binary transfer mode, data files with
      unrecognized types will be dumped to a local file after being
      transferred over as binary data.
    o Regardless of whether a window is in binary transfer mode or
      not, files with recognizes types (images, sound, etc.) will be
      handled as usual, and uncompression will be transparent as
      usual.
    o The whole point of all this is to allow the user to select on the
      fly how a given file of an unrecognized type is to be handled.
    o Because files are currently typed by filename extension,
      binary transfer mode should generally be kept off, otherwise
      it will screw up things like WAIS searches pretty badly. Also,
      since Gopher does things differently from everyone else,
      things are different there too.
    o Setting one of the multimedia resources to the text string
      "dump" will cause files of that type to be dumped to local
      disk as though in binary transfer mode.
    o See http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu:80/mosaic-docs/file-typing-issues.html 
      for a more thorough discussion of these issues.
 o Audio annotations for Sun's with /usr/demo/SOUND/record (or
   something similar) are now enabled. Resources
   recordCommandLocation and recordCommand are used to specify the
   command used to record sound; theoretically, this approach can be
   used on any platform with appropriate hardware and software,
   although SGI Indigo & Sun Sparcstation are the only two that I know
   of.
 o Search capability within documents: enter search term, scrollbar
   jumps to match and match is highlighted; repeat as desired.
 o Enhanced support for various Gopher types, including binary files
   and CSO phonebooks (sorry, phonebooks aren't supported yet, but at
   least now an error message shows up).
 o Spaces converted to +'s in keyword queries now.
 o Scrollbar arrows now increment a reasonable amount when viewing
   large documents.
 o Anonymous FTP password is now always user@host.domain,
   enabling access to every strange FTP server out there that I know of.
 o Pattern-matching to determine file type based on file name now uses
   caseless string compare.
 o Better default visited anchor color for non-SGI color displays.
 o Messages from libwww now show up in pop-up dialogs like they
   should.
 o Telnet never gets asked to use unrecognized -l flag.
 o Tar files are now always retrieved to local disk (and not displayed).
 o Replacement (and better) Archie interface.
 o Mail Developers window is cleared on each use.
 o New resource trackVisitedAnchors; can be used to turn off tracking
   of visited anchors altogether.
 o Better transparent uncompression support:
    o Gzipped (.z) files are now recognized and uncompressed on
      the fly (as well as .Z files, as before).
    o New resources uncompressCommand (default 'uncompress')
      and gunzipCommand (default 'gunzip').
 o As usual, little bugfixes and cleanups.

From 0.8 to 0.9
...............

 o Some multimedia support. Yew asked for it...
    o GIF, JPEG, TIFF, audio, AIFF, DVI, MPEG, MIME, XWD,
      PostScript automatically recognized.
    o Pipe to external viewers (with viewers set via X resource
      mechanism).
    o Also retrieve images, audio over Gopher.
    o But not over HTTP (unless you're running a modified HTTP
      server).
    o Inlined MIME/multimedia support will be coming down the
      road, so this is all just a temporary hack.
 o Transparent handling of compressed (.Z) files.
 o Hotlist now *always* saved after modification.
 o Fixed occasional infinite loop/crash for some 8-bit documents.
 o Fixed various parsing bugs associated with using <xmp> instead of
   <plaintext> internally.
 o Links to specific anchors now work properly.
 o Fixed bug with failure in repeated accesses via FTP.
 o Fixed bug with spurious ^M's in Gopher anchors.
 o Fixed bug opening local file while visiting remote file.
 o Fixed display bug with punctuation falling off end of line.
 o Fixed problem with BadAlloc crashes on some servers.
 o Annotation text features.
    o Choice of annotation links in header or footer.
    o Automatic (& fast) updating of annotations on every
      document view.
    o New defaultAuthorName resource to override use of normal
      fullname.
    o Annotations now always use machine's full name.
 o Menubar item 'Delete This Annotation'.
 o Audio annotations (SGI only, so far).
 o Fixed BadWindow bug for annotation window on DECstations.
 o All plaintext files can now be annotated.
 o Fixed occasional problem with size of hotlist/history windows.
 o Added sample app-defaults files to distribution.
 o New resources for multimedia stuff:
    o gifViewerCommand (default 'xv')
    o jpegViewerCommand (default 'xv')
    o tiffViewerCommand (default 'xv')
    o audioPlayerCommand (default 'showaudio' from Metamail
      distribution)
    o aiffPlayerCommand (default 'sfplay' -- SGI specific)
    o dviViewerCommand (default 'xdvi')
    o mpegViewerCommand (default 'mpeg_play')
    o mimeViewerCommand (default 'xterm -e metamail')
    o xwdViewerCommand (default 'xwud -in')
    o rgbViewerCommand (default 'ipaste' -- SGI specific)
    o postscriptViewerCommand
 o Deleted annotations now have all corresponding disk files removed.
 o Mosaic is smarter about the <plaintext> HTML token at the head of
   plaintext files.
 o Lots of little cleanups and bug fixes.

From 0.7 to 0.8
...............

 o Telnet access is enabled for IBM systems (and others that don't define
   'unix' by default).
 o TN3270 access is now available (probably will only work on IBM
   systems).
 o Underline setting now carries from window to window like it should.
 o Stupid little bugs nailed in open local file routines.
 o More stupid little bugs nailed in opening multiple windows.
 o Fixed buglet with text fields on some platforms.
 o Most plaintext documents can now be annotated (except for results of
   WAIS queries and those that use <plaintext> explicitly).
 o Annotate and Edit Annotation menubar entries disabled for stupid Ultrix,
   since the annotation window causes a spurious BadWindow error for no
   apparent reason at all.
 o Better colors (including brighter colors on non-SGI platforms).
 o Makefile option to compile with mono colors as the default.
 o Revised copyright notice.
 o A few random bugfixes and cleanups.

From 0.6 to 0.7
...............

 o Annotations!
    o Personal only (until smart servers get written).
    o Automatic inlining of annotation pointers into documents.
    o Annotations automatically persistent across sessions (naturally).
    o Annotations are subsequently editable/removable.
    o Lots of neat GUI things.
 o Underlined anchors! You're gonna love this.
    o 0, 1, 2, or 3 underlines for each of unvisited and previously
      visited anchor types.
    o Solid or dashed underlines for each of unvisited and previously
      visited anchor types.
 o Application exits when all windows are closed.
 o Support for <menu> and <dir>.
 o Better support for nested lists (filled bullets, empty bullets, 
   empty boxes).
 o Better selection capabilities:
    o Select by character.
    o New resource, fancySelections: if true, selections will be
      "pretty-printed" when pasted into a normal X window (with
      underlined headers, bullets for lists, etc.). This is modifiable
      per-window from the menubar also.
 o Additional command-line argument: free-standing URL will be used as
   home document, and overrides all other specifications (including
   WWW_HOME, X resource homeDocument, and -home flag). Is that
   enough ways to specify the home document??? :-)
 o Additional command-line flag -mono, for getting black&white fallback
   X defaults... you mono people out there are gonna have to let me know if
   I'm providing a decent set of mono resources. Should there be a
   distinction between -mono and -greyscale??
 o Middle button button in scrolled lists is now equivalent of
   double-clicking with left button.
 o Performance enhancement for history window's future list.
 o Fix for gopher connection port usage.
 o Fix for proper gopher and WAIS document titles.
 o Temporary fix to access Supreme Court documents on Cornell Law
   School server (if manager of that server is out there, please contact me --
   you have a problem).
 o Option menu for document title/url display at top of window.
 o Cute icons in upper right-hand corner of windows for quick window ID.
 o Previous search keyword is trimmed correctly.
 o Search keyword remains in text field until search is complete.
 o New 'Clear Global History' option (to revert all anchors back to the
   unvisited color).
 o Fixed bug in hotlist geometry layout.
 o Lots of new resources:
    o confirmExit
    o ghostviewCommand
    o mailCommand
    o printCommand
    o xtermCommand
    o globalHistoryFile
    o defaultHotlistFile
    o personalAnnotationDirectory
 o Tabs now behave absolutely properly in preformatted text.
 o Fixed premature signal setup causing coredump when ctrl-c was hit
   during startup.
 o Hotlist is saved every time it's changed, to avoid losing information.
 o Busy cursor is used more often, as it should be.
 o Better handling of telnet/xterm functions (forked into background;
   browser never lands on 'telnet' document).
 o Ghostview runs in background now.
 o Changed application class name to 'XMosaic' for consistency.
 o Minor bugfixes and cleanups.

From 0.5 to 0.6
...............

History window now shows both 'where you've been' and
  'where you can go'.
Previously visited nodes are colored differently, a la Midaswww;
  this global history is automatically persistent across sessions.
New resources for customization, including:
  Show URLs instead of Document Titles.
  Customize window per document feature.
  Optionally have pointer and focus warp to keyword entry field
    when you reach a searchable node.
  Optionally turn off global history mechanism.
  Specify home document (overridden by WWW_HOME env variable).
Button2 can now activate anchors; forces a new window
  to open (as with Window Per Document feature).
Going from a document necessarily wider than the window
  (e.g. preformatted text) to a normal document will now
  get rid of the horizontal scrollbar and reformat properly.
Scrollbar and document page state is maintained so stepping
  through the history list lands you were last in each document.
Addition of Whine option under Help.
Addition of Go To and Go To Local options under Navigate.
Addition of outlet to Ghostview for PostScript documents
  (this is a hack but it's a slick demo feature).
<listing> is now recognized.
Tabs now work in preformatted/plaintext regions.
Numeric character references are now handled.
Anchors without href's aren't colored anymore.
Search Keyword field's sensitivity is managed correctly now.
SIGINT now interrupts network connections too
  (so you can hit Ctrl-C in shell window at any time).
Memory leak in document reformatting nailed.
Cloning a window is now intelligent and doesn't do a network
  reload; also, window size is maintained.
Layout glitches fixed.
Text selection glitches fixed.
Other misc bugfixes and cleanups.
Better help.
