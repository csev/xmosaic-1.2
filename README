NCSA Mosaic for the X Window System
===================================

Welcome to NCSA Mosaic.

This README details installation steps.  More complete information and
documentation on NCSA Mosaic is available online, via NCSA Mosaic.


Binaries
--------

This release of NCSA Mosaic is known to compile on the following
platforms:

  SGI (IRIX 4.0.2) 
  IBM (AIX 3.2)
  Sun 4 (SunOS 4.1.2 with stock X11R4 and Motif 1.1).
  DECstation 5000-200 (Ultrix).
  DEC Alpha (OSF/1).

Binaries for these platforms are available on ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in
/Mosaic/xmosaic-binaries.

Rumor has it that Mosaic will compile on systems like:

  Hewlett Packard HP/UX 7.x, 8.x, 9.x.
  Dell SVR4
  Sun Solaris 2.x
  SCO Open Desktop
  Harris Nighthawk
  NeXT BSD
  
If you have to make changes to NCSA Mosaic to get it to compile on a
particular platform, please send a set of context diffs (e.g., 'diff
-c oldfile newfile') to mosaic-x@ncsa.uiuc.edu.


Installation instructions
-------------------------

So far, there's no toplevel Makefile.  This both simplifies and
complicates things.

Follow these steps:

(1) Examine and modify Makefile in libwww.  Do 'make'.

(2) Examine and modify Makefile in libhtmlw.  Do 'make'.

(3) Decide whether you want to compile with DTM and DMF support.

    DTM support allows you to send documents over NCSA's Data Transfer
    Mechanism protocol to NCSA Collage, a real-time collaboration tool
    that runs on X and Macs (available at ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in
    /Collab), and other DTM clients.  Once a text file is in Collage
    it can be freely edited or doodled upon, alone or in concert with
    other people over the network.

    DMF support would allow you to connect to NCSA Data Management
    Facility servers, if we had any publicly available accessible,
    which we don't, and which we probably won't in the future.

    If you're not interested in either of these things, then you
    shouldn't bother compiling them in.  Otherwise, you should compile 
    both of them in.

    If you don't want DTM and DMF support, go to step (6).

(4) Build the DTM library in libdtm (which has support for various
    architectures built in).  Do 'make sgi', 'make sun', or whatever.
    Some architectures aren't supported by libdtm; in the event that
    your particular architecture isn't, don't worry about it -- go
    straight to step (6).

(5) ONLY DO THIS IF YOU'VE ALSO DONE STEP 4: Examine and modify
    Makefile in libdmf.  Do 'make'.

(6) Examine and modify Makefile in src.

    If you didn't want DTM and DMF support in step (3), make sure and
    specify this in the Makefile where appropriate.

    Do 'make'.

(7) If you do not normally run Motif on your system (e.g., if you run
    Sun OpenWindows instead), then you may get a whole bunch of
    run-time errors about translations when you start Mosaic.

    If this happens, copy the file XKeysymDB (included in this
    directory) to /usr/lib/X11.  See the FAQ list online for more
    information.


X Defaults
----------

NCSA Mosaic includes sets of fallback X resources that provide
reasonable screen display properties for three configurations: color,
monochrome, and color SGI.  (Color SGI has its own configuration since
SGI systems commonly use a gamma correction factor of 1.7, which makes
their screens brighter than usual.)

If you compile NCSA Mosaic out of the box, or if you download a binary
from ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu, the default resources will be for a color
display (or, if you compile on an SGI, the default will be for color
SGI).  See src/Makefile for information on how to have monochrome
resources by default.  On the command line, the flags '-mono' and
'-color' allow you to switch resource configurations at runtime.

For your convenience, three corresponding X app-defaults files are
included in this distribution: app-defaults.color,
app-defaults.color-sgi, and app-defaults.mono.


Bug Reports and Comments
------------------------

Bug reports and other comments can be sent to mosaic-x@ncsa.uiuc.edu.

If you find NCSA Mosaic useful or particularly interesting, please
also send us a note -- continued development of this project partially
depends on user feedback and support.
